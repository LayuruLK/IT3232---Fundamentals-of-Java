# IT3232---Fundamentals-of-Java: Java Programming Exercises üöÄ

## Introduction

Welcome to the **IT3232---Fundamentals-of-Java** repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of Java programs designed to help you master the fundamentals of Java programming, with a strong emphasis on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. Whether you're a beginner or an intermediate Java developer, this repository offers a variety of exercises that cover basic operations, algorithms, and real-world applications like student management, library systems, and retail systems.

The project is structured to provide a hands-on learning experience, allowing you to explore key Java concepts such as **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **class design**. Each program is carefully crafted to demonstrate how these concepts can be applied in practical scenarios.

## üöÄ Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Number Operations** üî¢
This section includes programs that perform basic number operations, such as printing sequences, reversing numbers, and checking for odd/even numbers. These exercises are designed to help you get comfortable with Java syntax and basic logic.

- **PrintMessage.java**: A simple program to print messages.
- **PrintNum.java**: Prints a sequence of numbers.
- **Reverse.java**: Reverses a given number.
- **OddEven.java**: Checks if a number is odd or even.
- **ReverseLR.java**: Swaps the left and right parts of a number.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Student Management System** üéì
This system demonstrates how to use classes and objects to manage student data. It calculates the average marks of students, showcasing the practical use of OOP concepts like **encapsulation** and **class design**.

- **Student.java**: Represents a student with attributes like name and marks.
- **StudentApp.java**: Calculates the average marks of students.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Library Management System** üìö
The library system is a perfect example of how **inheritance** and **polymorphism** can be used to manage different types of books. It supports three types of books:
- **PrintedBooks**: Includes attributes like page count.
- **EBooks**: Includes attributes like file size.
- **AudioBooks**: Includes attributes like duration.

- **Book.java**: The base class for all book types.
- **PrintedBooks.java**, **EBook.java**, **AudioBook.java**: Derived classes for specific book types.
- **Library.java**: Manages the collection of books and displays their details.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Retail & Product System** üõí
This system demonstrates how to implement **encapsulation** and basic business logic in a retail environment. It includes a `Product` class to represent products and a `Retail` class to manage product inventory.

- **Product.java**: Represents a product with attributes like name, price, and stock.
- **Retail.java**: Implements simple business logic to manage products.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for all exercises.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Core concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are extensively used.
- **IDEs**: The project can be run on any Java-supported IDE, such as **Eclipse**, **IntelliJ IDEA**, or **VS Code**.

## üîß How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LayuruLK/IT3232---Fundamentals-of-Java.git

2.  **Open in IDE:**
    -   Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code).
    -   Ensure your IDE is configured with a Java Development Kit (JDK).

3.  **Compile and Run:**
    -   Navigate to the Java file you wish to run.
    -   Compile the file using the IDE or command line:
        ```bash
        javac fileName.java
        ```
    -   Run the compiled file:
        ```bash
        java fileName
        ```
        (Replace `fileName` with the name of the Java file you want to execute, e.g., `StudentApp.java`).
